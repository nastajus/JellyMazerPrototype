## Jelly Mazer Prototype

The original project [Jelly Mazer](https://github.com/nastajus/JellyMazer) was taking too long, getting bogged down in design & overloaded with various assets I collected, which began causing problems with Unity being unable to attach debugger. I needed an unencumbered project to test out prototype ideas I've been theorizing on noting on paper the past few days. Here's that raw code, duplicated shamelessly for speed, and commented accordingly. The cleaned up version of this will make it's way back from this "offshoot" project into the original.
